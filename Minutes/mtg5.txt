For iteration 1, we need a simple script that will run the entire process for a single image. 
	- Carina is putting that script together. Need it done by next group meeting on 10/6
	- Script will convert image from .fitz. Then, run it through texture cam. Finally,
	push the output through the blob detector program. 
	-Discussed forking a new set of code so that the current stable 'release' isn't broken while we work on the flood fill algorithm. 

Brayden and Justin can calculate the available area now. 
	- Discussed using floodfill instead of contour analysis
	- Agreed that floodfill should be a goal for iteration 2
		- Can use blob detection on the threshold image
		- Use central points from the blob detector for flood fill to minimize scanning
		- Would need to filter by area during blob detection, not sure of required radius

		- Could also still cluster the bad blobs, then invert and use floodfill
		- Need to test with different images to see how it affects correctness

Carina and Courtney provided more images to test against.
	- Have new texture cam outputs that identify space correctly
	- Carina will push once she is able to access her work computer
