Tuesday, September 8th, Meeting #2

What we accomplished:
	- Worked on the remaining sections of the preliminary project proposal which Carina started.  Members need to add their backgrounds before submitting.

	- Outlined system components.
		First, on approach to target, OR takes many many images.  Use TextureCam to analyze the safe/dangerous areas.
		Then, using the color-coded results from TextureCam, measure blob sizes with OpenCV.
		After safe/dangerous blobs have been measured, rank them.
		Finally, output list with ranks, images, etc. for sample site to be chosen.

 	- Discussed more detailed needs for the project:
 		Need a fast way to feed images to TextureCam (script)
 		Also need to format image files as PGMs from FITs for TextureCam.  Can possibly be done with Gimp, would like an automated solution.  Maybe use ImageMagick or even OpenCV?
 		Need training images for TC
 		Must convert output images from TC (PPMs) to PNGs for OpenCV.
 		Don't forget scale!  Info will be attached to images, just need to do calculations (Carina may have something for that?)

 	- Decided how to split the work so teams of 2 can work in parallel: OpenCV and ranking will be handled by one team, TextureCam and image processing will be handled by another.  Integration and enhancements will be decided later or done with all members.

What we need to do next:
 - All members add background info to preliminary project proposal
 - Brayden doing final proofread
 - Justin making high-level block diagram
 - Continue working on setting up TextureCam and OpenCV
 - Prepare for proposal presentation? (Will be using Carina's slides)
