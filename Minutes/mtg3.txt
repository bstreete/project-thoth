Splitting work into ranking + blob analysis and texture cam + image processing
Justin & Brayden on OpenCV, Carina and Courtney on TextureCam
3 weeks until iteration 1 due (Oct 8th)

Carina will by tomorrow (9/15) afternoon: 
	- looking into server & shared drive use with Osiris Rex
	- send out sample images of all of the steps in the process (original fits, texturecam ppm, texturecam pgm, png of TextureCam overlay)
	-send blob detection example. 
GOALS
	- Have access for using OpenCV and TextureCam (according to your task) by next meeting
	- C&C look into ImageMagic conversion software
	- C&C find a way to superimpose images (openCV or ImageMagic) probably. 
	- By next week, have structure/interfaces designed for input/outputs. 
	- Next 2 weeks - have all modules working.
	- 3rd week - work on integration.


----
Current status after C&C 9/20 meeting:
Investigated ImageMagick, DS9, etc -> NOPE.
Used Gimp to make scripts to convert .fits to .pgm, convert .ppm to .png
Investigated using gimp for superimposing images:  
	1: load layer (gimp-file-load-layer) and image
	2: set opacity (gimp-layer-set-opacity)
	3: add layer to image (gimp-image-add-layer)
ToDo: Make sure TextureCam is set up by Tuesday, Write script to feed images to TextureCam
Meet again Tuesday after class & group meeting
